cyaflight - crossplatform yaflight
===================================

yaflight is a flightgear launcher developed by me (<matteo@xquiet.eu>) using Gambas3 language.

Due to this reason it cannot be used by windows and macosx (still not at this time) users, 
so I felt the need to rewrite this launch control using C++ and the Qt framework.
